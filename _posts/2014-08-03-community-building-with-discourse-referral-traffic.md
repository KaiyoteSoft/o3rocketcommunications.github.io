One of my friends recently wrote an excellent blog post on <a href="http://blog.discourse.org/2014/08/building-a-discourse-community/" target="_blank">Building a Discourse Community</a>. &nbsp;Discourse is a new open source forum software that is an improvement over systems like vBulletin and phpBB. &nbsp;The <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/about-me/" target="_blank">author </a>is one of the legends of online community development, known for creating StackOverflow. &nbsp;His perspective, shaped from both StackOverflow and Discourse, can be applied to any forum.<br />
<br />
I've applied my own perspective on the steps he recommends:<br />
<br />
<ol>
<li>Clearly define the purpose of the community;</li>
<li>Organize discussion and seed with content;</li>
<li>Commit to engagement by staff;</li>
<li>Generate awareness.</li>
</ol>
<div>
Jeff, uses the term, "How do we find it?" &nbsp;As I am a marketer, I can't help but frame every problem I see as a marketing problem. &nbsp; &nbsp;To me, this means a form of marketing promotion called, "awareness." &nbsp;Jeff discusses the following techniques to increase awareness:</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Prominently link to the forum from your main website in the top-level navigation bar;</li>
<li>Include links to the forum in newsletters and direct email campaigns;</li>
<li>Link to the forum from your blog;</li>
<li>Promote links on Twitter, Facebook and other social media.</li>
</ol>
<div>
These are all great. &nbsp;It may be enough for most people. &nbsp;If you want to do more, I suggest three basic techniques as next steps:</div>
</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Measure referral traffic;</li>
<li>Manage forum brand externally;</li>
<li>Integrate with marketing campaigns.</li>
</ol>
<div>
This post will explain the most important technique, measurement of referral traffic.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
<span style="font-size: large;">Measure It!</span></div>
</div>
<div>
Craig's law of marketing is, "if you measure it, they will come." &nbsp;I learned this lesson many years ago from a billionaire Russian entrepreneur who is a technical genius. &nbsp;The basic premise is that measurement creates focus of limited labor resources. &nbsp; In order to allocate time resources, we must prioritize. &nbsp; Focus leads to results. &nbsp;If you are marketing the community yourself, you will naturally do the high-value things first if you know what the valuable things are. &nbsp;To prioritize YouTube over Twitter or a newsletter over a blog, you first need to measure the effectiveness of each channel before you can make a decision. &nbsp;There are many ways to measure the source of awareness, the top two are: surveys and web analytics. &nbsp;If you have time, do both. &nbsp;If you have time for only one, look at your web analytics.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
Discourse comes with referral traffic analytics built into the system. &nbsp;From the main admin dashboard, look at "Top Traffic Sources." &nbsp;In the example below on a test site, the top three sources are:</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>A companion blog for the site</li>
<li>StackOverflow external site</li>
<li>External blog</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-eKgrIhVqKf0/U95mOKu0_xI/AAAAAAAANK4/wjVrZYesMK0/s1600/discourse_referral.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-eKgrIhVqKf0/U95mOKu0_xI/AAAAAAAANK4/wjVrZYesMK0/s1600/discourse_referral.png" /></a></div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
From this example, I can see that the companion blog that I wrote for my test drove the most traffic. &nbsp;It also takes the most time. &nbsp;The traffic from StackOverflow, a popular question and answer site, &nbsp;was not part of any activity on my part. &nbsp;Someone randomly linked to content on the forum. &nbsp;The traffic from the PossiblyWrong blog is similar. &nbsp;I have answered questions on both StackOverflow and PossiblyWrong, so I did do work. &nbsp;However, the technique did not involve direct link placement on my part.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
The Discourse analytics also comes with site content analytics.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<br /></div>
<div>
Popular content generally reflects what people find valuable. &nbsp;From looking at this data, it's clear that most people are getting stuck with the installation on Windows. &nbsp;As this is just a test, I'm taking no action. &nbsp;However, if I wanted to advance the forum, I would look into improving the installation of the library on Windows and then improving the documentation of the process. &nbsp;</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
Since the blog is the top traffic referral source, I look at how people find the blog using analytics from the blog platform. &nbsp;In this case, the test blog is on blogger.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-56gDSJC1mzU/U95qltIEhUI/AAAAAAAANLQ/ZDGmiTAdTso/s1600/blogger_stats.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-56gDSJC1mzU/U95qltIEhUI/AAAAAAAANLQ/ZDGmiTAdTso/s1600/blogger_stats.png" /></a></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<br /></div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
Based on this data, I can see that the top traffic sources are:</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Google organic search</li>
<li>StackOverflow</li>
<li>PossiblyWrong external blog</li>
<li>YouTube companion site</li>
</ol>
<div>
By tracking data, I have a better understanding of how to spend my time. &nbsp;Large campaigns follow this same process. &nbsp;Although the example here shows a small test Discourse deploy, I've used similar techniques on community campaigns for larger companies like Cisco, SAP, and VMware. &nbsp;Regardless of the size of the campaign, time is always in short supply and must be used effectively.</div>
