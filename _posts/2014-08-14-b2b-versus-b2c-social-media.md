One of the most common questions for a social media Business to Business (B2B) campaign is
where to spend your time.  The quick answer is LinkedIn.  

B2B campaigns differ from Business to Consumer (B2C) campaigns.  Despite
changes to Facebook Pages that make it more expensive to market to
potential customers, Facebook still remains at the core of most B2C campaigns.

Here are some charts from The Social Media Examiner poll of 2,800 marketers.

This helps with an allocation of time resources.  In the future, we'll discuss LinkedIn ads, LinkedIn Pages and LinkedIn groups.
