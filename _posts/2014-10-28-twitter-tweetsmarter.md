Rich media is more effective in Twitter.

Twitter recently published a report that analyzed the effectiveness of Tweets and
advertisements targeted at small businesses.  While I've [seen pretty weak results from 
Twitter for B2B referral traffic][referral] in campaigns targeted at SMBs, I continue to
invest time in Twitter.  Like most B2B marketers,[Twitter is the third priority for allocation
of time resources][1].  

Twitter remains attractive because there is higher engagement on Twitter, retweets, favorites, follows,
customer feedback, compared to Facebook and LinkedIn.  While Twitter continues to lag in directing
referral traffic back to the website, it manages to to drive measurable user-to-user engagement inside
of Twitter.  It feels that this engagement within the Twitter space should translate into engagement
with the website at some point.

Here are some tips that caught my attention:

1. Tweets <100 characters get more engagement.  If you use the entire 140 character space, it becomes
more difficult to pass the Tweet on.
2. Photos gets +313% engagement and +52% retweets (engagement as defined by Twitter)
3. Videos get +256% engagement versus Tweets with a picture.  In the example from Twitter, the
Tweet uses Vine, the video service that Twitter acquired.
4. Tweets with a photo series get +173% engagement versus Tweets with a single picture.

In order to use pictures more effectively, I've been using free photo editing software called 
Gimp almost every day.  Gimp is similar to Photoshop.  I started to use Gimp regularly as part of my hobby 
to build mobile games. I also started to use corporate font packs and color palettes.  Fortunately,
my hobby with mobile development also gives me some comfort with fonts and rgb colors.

I'm also getting tips from digital photographers.  On Sunday I went down to the [Harmony II
Exhibit][2] in Palo Alto to talk to my friend Robert Read who is a hobbyist photographer in 
addition to a software developer.

Currently, the profile of Twitter marketer is a person, usually young, that is strong is text.
This makes it a natural transition for PR people to take up social media marketing, Twitter
often being the easiest.  However, with the effectiveness of pictures and short videos over
text, the effective Twitter marketer now requires more visual and graphic skills.
