I took a look at the champion pitch for the 14th Founder Showcase put on by the Founder Institute.  The pitch is 3.5 minutes long. Each slide is categorized: 1) problem definition; 2) impact of problem or solution; 3) solution or product description; 4) company achievements; 5) financial milestones and business model.

I walked from my house to Philz Coffee in Palo Alto yesterday to meet my old surfing friend, <a href="http://rerereboot.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Manabu Tokunaga</a>, also known as Da Stokemaster. &nbsp;I usually don't surf with Manabu now days, preferring to catch easy roller waves with my son in Eastside Santa Cruz. <br />
<br />
As you can imagine, meeting in Palo Alto did not involve surfing. &nbsp;In between his 150+ surfing sessions a year, Manabu decided to start his third medical software company. &nbsp;Although I've known him for years, I didn't realize that one of his companies was sold for $240 million to Siemens. &nbsp;At the time, he was managing engineering and wasn't running the business side of things.<br />
<br />
Today, he's COO of an open source medical software startup that is just getting started. &nbsp;He's built an impressive product and wanted to talk to me about preparing for a short 2 minute funding practice pitch. &nbsp;My suggestion was to analyze winners of this type of on-stage quick pitch format.<br />
<br />
To help him out, I took a look at the <a href="http://vimeo.com/70649722" target="_blank">champion pitch</a> for the 14th Founder Showcase put on by the Founder Institute. &nbsp;The pitch is 3.5 minutes long. <br />
<br />
I watched the video and recorded the time the winner spent on each slide. &nbsp;I then categorized each slide in one of five categories: 1) problem definition; 2) impact of problem or solution; 3) solution or product description; 4) company achievements; 5) financial milestones and business model.<br />
<br />

<br />

<p>

Despite the constraints of a 3:30 minute pitch, the winner spent the biggest block of time on financial information, followed by business achievements. &nbsp; The presenter didn't spend that much time on the product. &nbsp;Though, from looking at the slides, he probably intended to spend more time on the product.</div>
</p>
<p>
The breakdown of the 21 slides is as follows:
</p>


<a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-adwq7y05L6M/U9paAn1KW1I/AAAAAAAANKY/ly-gH4ntWv8/s1600/funding_deck_by_slides.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-adwq7y05L6M/U9paAn1KW1I/AAAAAAAANKY/ly-gH4ntWv8/s1600/funding_deck_by_slides.png" /></a>

<br />
As you can see, the biggest block of slides is on the product, followed by achievements. &nbsp;The financial slides are sparse. &nbsp;I suspect that the CEO got coaching prior to the pitch to focus more time on the financial information. &nbsp;In my opinion, founders are most comfortable talking about the product since that is what they've been focusing on and most importantly, the product is real. <br />
<br />
As soon as the founder leaves the discussion of the product, the world quickly starts to become murky and their discomfort increases. &nbsp;The business achievements are the second easiest thing to present since these are real things that were accomplished. &nbsp;There's generally a marketing spin to the achievements and thus the founder is often not that comfortable talking about what was accomplished, but this section is doable.<br />
<br />
The technology or idea must solve a specific problem in order for it to become a product. &nbsp;This process of defining the <i>problem </i>will be sorted out over time. &nbsp;Generally, the challenge here is one of focus. &nbsp;The technology can usually solve a large number of problems. &nbsp;The founder is usually reluctant to narrow the scope. &nbsp;The general hope is that the founder throws out the technology to the public and they help to define the product. &nbsp;However, since the challenge is really one of prioritization, people will agree on the top problem before the pitch.<br />
<br />
Market impact numbers are difficult to find, but the founder can generally find some analyst market numbers and drop them into the deck. &nbsp;As the numbers from the analyst generally don't precisely match the target market for the new company, the founder is slightly uncomfortable, but will put them into the deck.<br />
<br />
Then, we get to the financials, which are most important thing for investors and the most nebulous and stressful thing for founders.<br />
