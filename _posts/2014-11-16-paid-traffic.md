Here's a summary of data that Jordan Teicher pulled together for his
[blog][teicher] on Contently.

![Costs of Content Marketing](/img/blog/2014/11/content_marketing.png)

PR traditionally works on the basis of leveraging the brand of the 
reporter or publication to increase awareness.  For example, a placement 
in the New York Times is going to drive awareness for the company 
mentioned in it.  

In the case of self-published survey results, reports, 
blogs, whitepapers, or infographics, the company publishing the content
usually has a weak brand.  Search engines aren't enough to generate
traffic.  

There are many techniques to drive traffic:

- engagement with key influencers on social and directly;
- use media placements (PR)to drive traffic to content;
- connect content to events, partners;
- advertisements.

Within advertisements, there are many options.  As the results are
easily measureable, it's good to experiment with a half-dozen 
options to balance the cost of the ad versus the effectiveness
of the ad.

Please let me what your experience has been.

CPC = Cost per Click.  You only pay when the user takes a specific action
such as clicking on the link.

CPM = Cost per thousand impressions.  You pay to get a link to 
your content displayed.
