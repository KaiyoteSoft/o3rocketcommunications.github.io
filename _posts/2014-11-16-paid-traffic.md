Here's a summary of data that Jordan Teicher pulled together for his
[blog][teicher] on Contently.

![Costs of Content Marketing](/img/blog/2014/11/content_marketing.png)


There are many techniques to drive traffic:

- engagement with key influencers on social and directly;
- use media placements (PR)to drive traffic to content;
- connect content to events, partners;
- advertisements;
- SEO;
- audience optimization (choosing messages that resonate with
target audience).

For many years, PR has been the most effective tool for startups to gain
awareness.  It performs well compared to advertising for awareness,
but is difficult to measure for lead generation.

PR works because it leverages the brand of the 
reporter or publication to increase awareness.  For example, a placement 
in the New York Times is going to drive awareness for the company 
mentioned in it because the NY Times gets 30 million web readers
every month.

This is awesome.  However, there are fundalmental programs with this
type of placement.  First, the general mechanism to interface with
the media is to hire a PR firm at $12K to $20K per month.  Second,
once you get the initial pop of a company launch, funding announcement,
or product launch, your news funnel dries up.  You'll scramble to
get mentions, not feature placement.  

The third problem is perhaps the biggest problem.  Who reads the New York
Times?  The NY Times has 760,000 digital subscribers.  How many
of them are in New York?  How much weight does the brand have now days?

According to the New York Times, their homepage traffic is dropping
quickly.  Although dropping, the value of the New York Times 
brand is still huge.

We're in a transition time in marketing where companies are 
experimenting with a wide range of techniques.

As a result of changes to both PR and social media, companies are 
moving some resources to content marketing, which has the benefit
of being a great platform for messages.  Content marketing has the huge
disadvantage of not having a brand like the New York Times associated
with the content.

When using content marketing for self-published survey results, reports, 
blogs, whitepapers, or infographics, the company publishing the content
usually has a weak brand.  Search engines aren't enough to generate
traffic.  

There's a huge range of techniques to drive traffic to the
site.  All of them work.  It's just a matter of finding out
which is the cheapest way to get results.  I find it 
exhilarating that no one knows the right answer in 
every circumstance.  Within a few miles of my home in Palo Alto,
I have the opportunity to talk to some
of the greatest minds in marketing, especially digital marketing.

Just lack week, I dove into the difference between 
SEO and audience optimization.  During the same day,
I spoke to both experts in SEO that focused keywords and
engagement techniques, as well as experts from Inc Magazine
that explained audience optimizations techniques focused on
offering something to the audience that they will learn if they
read the content.  It was so great to get two different perspectives
back to back.

Like SEO and audience optimization, advertising results are
easily measureable.  It's good to experiment with a half-dozen 
options to balance the cost of the ad versus the effectiveness
of the ad.

Please let me what your experience has been.

CPC = Cost per Click.  You only pay when the user takes a specific action
such as clicking on the link.

CPM = Cost per thousand impressions.  You pay to get a link to 
your content displayed.
