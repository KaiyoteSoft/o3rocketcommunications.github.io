As marketers balance budgets across social media, PR, advertising, and direct email lead-generation
campaigns, they're allocating more money to produce high-quality content such as 
whitepapers, survey reports, infographics, and blogs across a range of awareness and lead-generation
campaigns.  To get more people to view the
content, companies are turning to advertising.  In many cases, the advertising products
they are buying are different from traditional
advertisements used in lead generation campaigns.

Here's a summary of data that Jordan Teicher pulled together for his
[blog][teicher] on Contently.  It gives a good overview of the
common platforms that people use to increase views to content
such as a blog or infographic.

In order to decide how much money to spend on advertising for corporate
content, you need to understand what else you could spend money on.  Sure,
advertising will work, but is it the cheapest way to get traffic?

There are many techniques to drive traffic to corporate content:

- Public relations (PR). Use media placements to drive traffic to content;
- engagement with key influencers on social and directly;
- connect content to events, partners;
- advertisements;
- SEO;
- audience optimization (choosing messages that resonate with
target audience).

###PR works. Why not take the advertising budget and move it to PR?

For many years, PR has been the most effective tool for startups to gain
awareness.  I definitely rode that wave with Page One PR and benefited 
greatly from that trend.  PR is still the core service that I offer and
I believe in the value of a PR campaign.  

Dollar for dollar, PR will out-perform advertising for awareness,
but PR is difficult to measure for lead generation.

PR works because it leverages the brand of the 
reporter or publication to increase awareness.  For example, a placement 
in the New York Times is going to drive awareness for the company 
mentioned in it because the NY Times gets 30 million web readers
every month.  This is awesome.

###Why you need more than just PR

However, there are fundalmental programs with this
type of placement.  First, the general mechanism to interface with
the media is to hire a PR firm at $12K to $20K per month.  Second,
once you get the initial pop of a company launch, funding announcement,
or product launch, your news funnel dries up.  You'll scramble to
get mentions, not feature placement.  

The third problem is perhaps the biggest problem.  Who reads the New York
Times?  According to their rather dark and gloomy [New York Times Innovation Report][report], 
the NY Times has 760,000 digital subscribers.  How many
of them are in New York?  How much weight does the brand have now days?

According to the New York Times, their homepage traffic is dropping
quickly and even their iPad app is losing subscribers.  
This is just one example of how a publication is losing in value.
The question is whether people are getting the information from other sources
like Huffington Post and USA Today or if they are getting information from their
peers or directly from the companies producing products and services.

They're getting information from a growing number of sources.  The
diversification of sources creates a management problem.  How do you track 30
marketing campaigns if you just have two people in marketing?


###Why best-in-class marketing consultants need help

We're in a transition time in marketing where companies are 
experimenting with a wide range of techniques.  Years ago, you just 
needed to hire the best advertising firm.  Then, you needed to
hire the best ad firm and another PR firm.  Over time, this
expanded into a group of specialized boutique firms for SEO,
social media, lead generation, content marketing 
and digital advertising.

This results in an overload of work for the VP of marketing.  It's not
clear if they'll emerge a type of consultant that functions like a
general contractor, similar to what we see in the construction
business.


###Rise of content marketing problems

While I haven't come up a solution of how the VP of marketing 
can effectively deal with multiple
vendors yet, I do know that as a result of changes to both PR and 
social media, companies are 
moving some resources to content marketing.  Content marketing
has the benefit
of being a great platform for messages, but it has the huge
disadvantage of not having a brand like the New York Times associated
with the content.

When using content marketing for self-published survey results, reports, 
blogs, whitepapers, or infographics, the company publishing the content
usually has a weak brand.  Search engines aren't enough to generate
traffic.  

There's a huge range of techniques to drive traffic to the
site.  All of them work.  It's just a matter of finding out
which is the cheapest way to get results.  I find it 
exhilarating that no one knows the right answer in 
every circumstance.  Within a few miles of my home in Palo Alto,
I have the opportunity to talk to some
of the greatest minds in marketing, especially digital marketing.

Just lack week, I dove into the difference between 
SEO and audience optimization.  During the same day,
I spoke to both experts in SEO that focused keywords and
engagement techniques, as well as experts from Inc Magazine
that explained audience optimizations techniques focused on
offering something to the audience that they will learn if they
read the content.  It was so great to get two different perspectives
back to back.

###Process framework of test and measurement

Like SEO and audience optimization, advertising results are
easily measureable.  It's good to experiment with a half-dozen 
options to balance the cost of the ad versus the effectiveness
of the ad.

This process of measurement and adjustment is solution to how to handle 
the deluge of marketing tasks.  The real problem that is emerging is
deciding what to measure.  The wealth of data is causing marketers
to rethink campaigns.  We're faced with a fresh, new frontier and it's 
exciting to be a part of it.

CPC = Cost per Click.  You only pay when the user takes a specific action
such as clicking on the link.

CPM = Cost per thousand impressions.  You pay to get a link to 
your content displayed.
