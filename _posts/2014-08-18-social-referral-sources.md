LinkedIn beats Facebook for referral traffic in B2B social media campaigns.

My previous blog post focused on [how people manage their time in B2B social
media campaigns][1].  This post shows why B2B social media marketers spend more time 
on LinkedIn.

Most marketing campaigns involve increasing traffic to a web site.  In many cases,
 Google Analytics is used to measure web site traffic.  In addtion to the number of
views to the site, Google Analytics will also provide information on where the 
visitor came from.  This is called, *referral traffic*.

In July of 2014, LinkedIn drove the most traffic to web sites in B2B campaigns
that I manage.  The data is based on organic traffic only, no advertisements.
In this example, time was spend equally across LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, and 
Google+.  The data shows that for the same amount of time, LinkedIn will 
generate more traffic.

Once the visitor gets the company web site from social media, I use other
tools to track the visitor to the point they become a customer.
