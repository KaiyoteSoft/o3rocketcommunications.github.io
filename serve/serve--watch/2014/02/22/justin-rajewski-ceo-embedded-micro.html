      <p><img src="/img/blog/2014/02/mojo_head.jpg" height="50" align="left" hspace="3" /> If there were an Olympic medal for hardware hacking, Justin Rajewski, 
the CEO of 
<a href="http://embeddedmicro.com/">Embedded Micro</a>, would probably get it.  </p>

<hr />

<p><img src="/img/blog/2014/02/justin.jpg" alt="Justin and Craig" title="Justin Rajewski, hardware super hacker" class="pull-right img-responsive" /></p>

<p>While most of us take pride in simply being able to use a 
soldering iron, Justin is way, way beyond our level.  He
started designing circuits and circuit boards in
high school.  He then took that crucial step of launching his
project to the world, impacting the lives of real people.  He called 
up a manufacturer, had the boards built, assembled the 
components, and started selling product, first
on his own and then through distributors.  Yea, at an age when most teenagers
were stoked just to build a simple robot from a kit with some servos, 
Justin was ripping into 
<a href="http://www.cadsoftusa.com/eagle-pcb-design-software/product-overview/">Eagle PCB design software</a> 
and getting stuff built, at
real manufacturing facilities.</p>

<p>In the summers, Justin worked at Northrop Grumman and discovered
that there was a whole new world of power and flexibility
with the more arcane, but rapidly growing
area of Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) that enable electronic
designers to completely control the hardware.  Justin had designed
the boards and mapped out the paths of discrete components,
now he could design the chips.</p>

<p>OK, take a pause and think about what you would do. Here’s the difference between guys like you and I
that come up with ideas and guys like Justin that get major
stuff done.  You and I would probably start learning about
FPGA and possibly buy a board to experiment with, get some LEDs
to blink, possibly run a servo, take a YouTube video of the project
 and then call it a day.  </p>

<p>But Justin isn’t a normal hacker like us.  He goes big. He decided
that FPGA was so cool that the rest of the world needed to learn
about it and he was going to move the world in that direction.</p>

<p>To get his project started, Justin built a prototype and put a video up on Kickstarter.  You can see the prototype below with hand-soldered connections.  Wow, the man can definitely use a soldering iron!
Even before he graduated from the EE department of Stanford University,
Justin was CEO of a fast-growing electronics FPGA board company with four
distributors in the US and one in Germany.  His board, 
<a href="http://embeddedmicro.com/development-boards/mojo-v3.html">the Mojo</a>, is on version
3 and he’s developed add-on boards to the Mojo to add a clock/visualizer shield, a servo shield, and a SDRAM shield. </p>

<p>Hardware hacking has gone mainstream.  Most of us are familiar with 
the hardware hacking product stars Raspberry Pi and Arduino. 
Those platforms
were not challenging enough for Justin.  </p>

<p>He chose to specialize in designing
with FPGA to unlock the almost limitless possibilities of building
any type of digital circuit to accomplish any type of task. Imagine an automobile hot rodder going from buying engines from Ford
to designing every aspect of their own engine and then building 
it in their shop.</p>

<p>Here’s a section from the Embedded Micro site that explains Justin’s passion for FPGA:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
     You can think of an FPGA as a blank slate. By itself an FPGA does nothing. It is up to you (the designer) to create a configuration file, often called a bit file, for the FPGA. Once loaded the FPGA will behave like the digital circuit you designed!
</p>

<p>
     One of the reasons FPGAs are so awesome is that unlike an ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuit) the circuit design is not set and you can reconfigure an FPGA as many times as you like!
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m just glad we have hackers like Justin to fill in the blank slates in technology and teach the rest of us what to do with those blank slates.</p>
